Solutions for 3 Questions asked by Import.io
How long did you spend on this assessment in total?
Around 4 hours.

What was the most difficult task?
First and second question was difficult. I have no experience in JS. I had to install nodejs and npm on local machine. Make sure i'm able to run on port 3000. I had to build the index.js file locally and then was able to write the Dockerfile. Tried CMD instead of ENTRYPOINT, was not able to run index.js, then modified to it to ENTRYPOINT and it worked.
In second one, i had the idea but I've mostly worked on freestyle Jenkins projects and less or groovy scripts and multistage build and took more time in pipelines.


If you had an unlimited amount of time to complete this task, what would you have done differently?
Yes, I would have tried to optimize my code. Would have tried other CI CD tools like Circle CI or Bitbucket Pipelines. For Dockerfile, i would have gone with multi-stage build to reduce the size of image, etcs.
